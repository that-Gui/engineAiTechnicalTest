# engineAI Technical Test Exercise

- First run the following command to install the dependencies: npm install
- Then run the following command to run the code: npm run dev

I began the chalenge using my usual tactic of breaking the work down to smaller task and then tackling them one by one. I started by creating the basic structure of the project and then I moved on to creating the basic functionality of the project.

Spent about 12 hours in total on this project as i understand its mainly an exercise to see how i approach a problem and how i solve it.

## Production errors =>

- Firstly i would have linked to utilise typescript as it would have helped me solve a lot of the errors and props types.
- I would have also used a state management library like tanstack manage state, loading, etc.
- I would have liked more time so in order to make the table and chart more dynamic and over engineered, please see exampleTable.tsx for a sense of what i would have done.
- Lastly i would have liked to have more effiecient logic and error handling.
